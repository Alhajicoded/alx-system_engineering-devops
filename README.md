I experienced an incident on the 2nd of july 2023.
All my sandboxes were down, i.e it reached the limit and i had to destroy one of them so as to be able to work on my task/project.
After destroying one of the sandbox, i was able to use it but couldn't navigate to any directory.
Unknown to me, i was suppose to clone again the directory i want to navigate to. I couldn't work on my task for that day, i asked one of my peers and he was able to help after 24hrs of searching for solutions on internet. He told me that i just had to clone that repository again. I did and it worked out for me.
